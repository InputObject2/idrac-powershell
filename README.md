Getting the console to work on 11th gen+ PowerEdge servers

I took the java parameters from some other source before and wrapped it in a nice, easy to use Powershell tool. The Java version needed is 1.7.0. [It can be acquired here.](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html)

Running the script will prompt at first to add a server, further runs will show the list and allow a user to connect to the servers that were already entered.

The list can also be entered into the included .csv file.
